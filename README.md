## How It Works

1. Fetches Users & Assets data from the Immich PostgreSQL database
2. Processes images through ResNet152 to extract feature vectors
3. Stores vectors in the Qdrant vector database
4. Uses vector similarity to identify similar/duplicate photos
5. Displays similar photo groups based on the configured threshold
6. Manages asset deletion by updating Immich database directly:
   - Follows Immich's deletion logic for compatibility
   - **Important**: Enable trash feature in Immich settings first
   - Deleted assets appear in Immich's trash where you can permanently delete or restore them



## Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

- `Find Similar`
  - Starts searching for the next photo that matches your `Threshold Min` settings and shows it in the `current` tab
  - When photo groups appear in the `current` tab, you can click on a photo's header to select it. This lights up the four action buttons on the top right. After using one of these actions, the kept photos in that group will be marked as resolved
  - If you don't do anything with a searched group, it'll show up in the `pending` tab waiting for you to handle it later

- `Clear records & Keep resolved`
  - Clears out search records that haven't been resolved yet
  - This keeps all the records you've already marked as resolved

- `Reset records`
  - Resets all search records, including the ones you've marked as resolved


### Search Configuration

- Make the most of `Auto Selection`
  - When you enable auto selection, it'll automatically choose which photos to keep or delete after you run `Find Similar`. Just scroll through to review, then hit one of the four action buttons at the top

- `Multi Mode (Muod)` search feature
  - By default (when `Multi Mode` is off), it only searches for one group of photos at a time
  - Turn this on and set the `Max Group` number when you've got tons of photos to filter through - super handy for big cleanups
  - **Note: Multi Mode and Related Tree are mutually exclusive**

- Related Tree (rtree)
  - **Only available in single group mode (when Multi Mode is off)**
  - When `Related Tree` is off, `Find Similar` only shows photos directly related to the main photo
  - Turn it on and it'll also search for photos related to those related photos, creating a comprehensive similarity tree
  - **Cannot be used together with Multi Mode for performance and clarity reasons**
  - `MaxItems` limits how deep the search goes. Say you set the threshold to `(0.5, 1)` - that might trigger endless searching if you have 100k photos, so this cap keeps things under control
  - Note: The number of photos directly related to the main photo isn't limited by `MaxItems`

**Mode Selection**: Choose Single Mode + Related Tree for comprehensive similarity trees, or Multi Mode for quick processing of multiple separate groups.

### Advanced Strategies

- **Progressive cleaning approach**
  - Start with the highest similarity threshold and work your way down:
    - First, get rid of exact duplicates `(0.97-1.00)`
    - Then find near-duplicates `(0.90-0.97)`
    - Finally, catch similar but different shots `(0.80-0.90)`
  - This way you tackle the obvious duplicates first, then deal with the photos that need more careful judgment

- **Clear and rescan strategy**
  - Before changing your threshold settings, use `Reset Records` to wipe all similarity data
  - This lets you rescan all photos with new thresholds and avoid missing anything or getting false matches

- **Auto Selection optimization**
  - Configure selection criteria: FileSize +3 for higher quality, Name Longer +3 for descriptive filenames
  - Review auto-selected results before batch processing

- **Large collection tips**
  - For 8000+ photos: Enable Multi Mode with appropriate Max Group settings
  - Use batch operations for efficiency

- **External library considerations**
  - Ensure external library paths are not set to read-only if using Docker Compose
  - Enable Immich's recycle bin feature before processing external libraries
  - Remember that MediaKit reads from Immich thumbnails, so original file locations don't affect similarity detection

## Installation & Setup

### Installation Method Selection Guide

Choose the installation method that suits your needs:

| Installation Method | Use Case | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---------------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Docker Compose** | Quick trial, simple deployment | One-click install, auto Qdrant setup | CPU only, no GPU acceleration |
| **Source Installation** | GPU acceleration needed, custom environment | GPU acceleration support, customizable | Manual Qdrant and dependency setup |

**Recommended Choice:**
- üöÄ **First-time users or small photo collections**: Use Docker Compose
- ‚ö° **Large collections or performance requirements**: Use source installation + GPU

### Prerequisites

- Access to an Immich installation with trash feature enabled
- A configured `.env` file (see below)

### Set up your Immich database
Before you can use mediakit, you need to set your database up, so MediaKit can connect to it. This explanation covers only Immich installations via docker compose.

#### Immich on the same host as mediakit
If your Immich installation is on the same machine than you want to install MediaKit on, a docker network can be used to connect to the db.
To create the network execute the following command (on the host, not in the docker container):
```bash
docker network create immich-mediakit
```

Then add the netowrk to your immich database container and to the docker compose:
```yaml
services:
  database:
    container_name: immich_postgres
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/postgres:14-vectorchord0.3.0-pgvectors0.2.0
    networks: # Add the immich-mediakit network to the db to allow immich-mediakit to access the db
      - immich-mediakit


networks: # Add the immich-mediakit network to the immich docker compose without any indentation
  immich-mediakit:
    external: true
```

After updating, restart Immich to apply the changes. The `PSQL_HOST` in your `.env` file should match the container name of the database.

#### Immich on a different host as mediakit
If your Immich installation is on a different machine than you want to install MediaKit on, you need to expose the PostgreSQL port. Note that this exposes your database to anyone in the hosts network, so use a secure password!
Add the following port mapping to your Immich's docker compose:

```yaml
services:
  database:
    container_name: immich_postgres
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/postgres:14-vectorchord0.3.0-pgvectors0.2.0
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Add this line to expose PostgreSQL
```

After updating, restart Immich to apply the changes. The exposed port (5432 in this example) should match the `PSQL_PORT` setting in your MediaKit `.env` file.


### Option 1: Docker Compose
Using Docker Compose is the easiest installation method, automatically including the Qdrant vector database.

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Docker Compose version currently cannot use GPU hardware acceleration**
- Only CPU vectorization processing is available, which will be slower
- If you need GPU acceleration, please use Option 2 source installation

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Copy Docker Configuration Files**

   The compose has a few differences when you're installing MediaKit on the same host vs on a different host than Immich. Choose the same as you have for setting up the database.
   
   [Same host](./docker/docker-compose-same-host.yml)
   
   [Different host](./docker/docker-compose-different-host.yml)
   
   [docker/.env](./docker/.env)

3. **Modify the `PSQL_HOST` and `IMMICH_PATH` in the `.env` file**

4. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. **Access Application**
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8086`

### Option 2: Source Installation (GPU Acceleration Supported)
If you need GPU hardware acceleration or want a custom installation.

**Use Cases:**
- Need GPU acceleration for vectorization processing
- Want to customize Python environment
- Need to modify source code

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Install Qdrant Server**
   ```bash
   # Install Qdrant using Docker
   docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
   ```

2. **Clone Source Code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RazgrizHsu/immich-mediakit.git
   cd immich-mediakit
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create `.env` file and set connection information (refer to the example above)

4. **Install Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Linux System Notes:**
   - For GPU acceleration, install CUDA and corresponding PyTorch version first
   - May need additional system packages: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev libffi-dev`

5. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   python -m src.app
   ```


## Developer Notes

Initially, I was planning to build this with Electron + React frontend + Node.js backend, but given how much easier it is to integrate machine learning stuff with Python, I ended up going the Python route.

I usually use Gradio for quick AI demos, but it gets pretty limiting when you want more customization. Same story with Streamlit - they're great for prototypes but not so flexible for complex UIs. After trying a bunch of different options, I settled on Dash by Plotly. Sure, it still needs a lot of custom work to get exactly what I want, but it gets the job done pretty well.

What started as a simple little tool to help me clean up duplicate photos somehow turned into this whole complex system... funny how these things grow, right?

Hope this tool helps anyone who's dealing with the same photo organization headaches! :)
