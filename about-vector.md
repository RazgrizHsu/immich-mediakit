# Vector Database Implementation Comparison

## 1. Project Background and Requirements
When developing photo similarity search functionality, we need an efficient vector database to store and query feature vectors of images. This is crucial for finding similar or duplicate photos.

## 2. FAISS Implementation Challenges

### 2.1 Custom ID Management Issues
We initially used FAISS's IndexIDMap wrapper to utilize custom IDs for indexing, which is necessary in photo management systems. However, IndexIDMap does not support direct retrieval of stored vectors by ID, and FAISS's reconstruct method cannot be used with this type of index.

### 2.2 Solution Attempts and Trade-offs
To address the above issues, we tried the following approaches:

1. **Vector Duplication**: Maintaining an additional ID-to-vector mapping dictionary, resulting in each vector being stored twice in memory
2. **Basic Index Usage**: Using original IndexFlatIP/IndexFlatL2 that support vector reconstruction, but require custom ID management implementation
3. **Indirect Retrieval Methods**: Attempting complex indirect search methods to retrieve vectors, which proved inefficient and unreliable

### 2.3 Memory Efficiency Issues with Large Datasets
For a system with 1 million entries, the FAISS + vector dictionary approach leads to significant memory waste:
- Each vector (2048-dimensional float32): ~8 KB
- FAISS index space: ~8 GB
- Vector dictionary space: ~8 GB
- Total memory usage: **approximately 16-17 GB**

## 3. Qdrant Solution Advantages

### 3.1 Functional Completeness
- Native support for accessing vectors via custom IDs without additional mapping layers
- Direct support for retrieving and comparing vectors by ID

### 3.2 Resource Efficiency
- Optimized memory usage: vectors are stored only once, no additional dictionary needed
- Architecture designed for large-scale vector management
